# Array 

## What's that?

An array is a special kind of data structure used to represent ordered maps of data. A map is a type of data that associates values with keys.

The values stored inside it don't necessarily have to be of the same type, as is the case in other programming languages.

The ability to use arrays inside other arrays, trees, etc., allows us to use multidimensional arrays.
